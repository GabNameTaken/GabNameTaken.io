                <p>Lack of sleep can cause detrimental effect to the immune system. Research is still currently undergoing as to why is sleep needed for the survival of a human, animal researches has shown that sleep is indeed necessary for its survival. An average lifespan for a rat is about 2 to 3 years. However for a sleep deprived rat, they only survive up to about 3 weeks. Sleep deprivation caused the rats to also develop abnormal low body temperatures and sores on its tail and paws which may be worsen as the immune system becomes impaired.</p>

                <p>Too little sleep will cause drowsiness and affect our concentration. It also leads to impaired memory and physical performance and reduce brain power. Hallucinations and mood swings may develop if you constantly are sleep deprived. Experts believe that sleep provides rest and maintenance for our neuorons when asleep. Hence, without sleep, the neurons may malfunction as it lacks too much energy or is polluted with byproducts of normal cellular activities.</p>

                <p>Deep sleeps plays apart in releasing of the growth hormone in children and young adults. Many of the bodyâ€™s cells also show increased production and reduced breakdown of proteins during deep sleep (Proteins are the foundation of cellular growth and recovery).

                    Brain activities of emotional control, decision-making processes, and social interactions are tremendously reduced during deep sleep. This can help people maintain emotional and social functions when awake. A study in rats also showed that certain nerve-signaling patterns which the rats generated during the day were repeated during deep sleep. This pattern repetition may help encode memories and improve learning.

                <p>Sleep and sleep-related problems play a role in a large number of human disorders and affect almost every field of medicine. Problems such as stroke and asthma attacks tend to occur more frequently at night and early morning due to changes in hormones,heart rate, and other sleep associated characteristics. REM sleep helps prevent seizures that begin in one area of the brain from spreading to other areas. Sleep deprivation triggers seizures in people.

                    Sleep also helps in the conservation of energy and resources for our body so that the immune system can fight off diseases.</p>
