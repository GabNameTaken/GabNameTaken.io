                <p>Pocket Scammers is a singleplayer 3D turn-based rpg that I led and made with my team of 4 for a studio project at NYP. Players can gain money and exp upon defeating a scammer. The money can then be spent on shops to buy combat skills. Combat skills are what you use to fight. A player can only have 4 skills equipped at each time. I did the shops, implementation of the skills, inventory, scene-switching and the first level design.</p>
