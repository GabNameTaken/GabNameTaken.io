            <p>I have had a passion for games throughout my life, playing a wide variety on various platforms. This enthusiasm drove me to explore the world of game development. Consequently, I pursued a diploma in Game Development & Technologies at Nanyang Polytechnic and successfully graduated. My interests are mostly indoor-based, including playing, watching, reading, and reviewing games, films, and anime. I also derive great pleasure from dining out and savoring good, affordable food, an appreciation I owe to someone special. Moreover, I occasionally dabble in simple cooking and baking, though my culinary skills remain a work in progress.</p>
